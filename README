This is a demo app for the resourceful_views rails plugin ( http://github.com/brontes3d/resourceful_views )

Using Braid to manage plugins: 
	sudo gem install braid

I had to upgrade git:

	curl http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.6.1.tar.bz2 | tar xj
	configre, make, make install
	
	in /usr/local/bin
	ls | grep git | xargs rm
